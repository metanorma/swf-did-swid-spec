== Terms and definitions

=== self-certifying identifier
admitted:[SCID]

object identifier derived from initial data such that an attacker could not create
a new object with the same identifier

=== Data Integrity

specification of mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of structured
digital documents using cryptography, such as digital signatures and other digital
mathematical proofs

[.source]
<<w3c-di>>


=== decentralized identifier
admitted:[DID]

[%metadata]
abbreviation-type:: initialism

type of identifier that enable verifiable, decentralized digital identities

NOTE: A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data
model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID.

<<DID-CORE>>


=== DID controller

entity that controls (create, updates, deletes) a given {{DID}}

[.source]
<<DID-CORE>>


=== DID document

the document returned when a {{DID}} is resolved

[.source]
<<DID-CORE>>


=== DID method

mechanism by which a particular type of {{DID}} and its associated
{{DID document}} are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated

NOTE: DID methods are defined using separate DID method specifications.

// NOTE: Done using bibliography
// === ISO8601
//
// A date/time expressed using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO8601 Standard].


=== JSON Canonicalization Scheme

method for canonicalizing a JSON structure such that is suitable
for verifiable hashing or signing according to <<RFC8785>>

[.source]
<<RFC8785>>


=== multibase

A specification for encoding binary data as a string using a prefix that
indicates the encoding.


=== multikey

A verification method that encodes key types into a single binary stream that is
then encoded as a <<multibase,multibase>> value.


=== multihash

mechanism for differentiating instances of hashes

NOTE: Software creating a hash prefixes (according to the specification) data to
the hash indicating the algorithm used and the length of the hash, so that
software receiving the hash knows how to verify it. Although multihash supports
many hash algorithms, for interoperability, {{DID controllers}} *MUST* only use
the hash algorithms defined in the specification as permitted.

=== W3C VCDM

verifiable credential according to <<w3c_vc-data-model-20>>
