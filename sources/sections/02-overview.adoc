== Overview

This specification defines the `did:swid` method for {{Decentralized Identifier,options="linkmention,linkref"}}
(DIDs). DIDs using this method can be used as Spatial Web Identifiers (SWIDs).
See <<SWIDS-AND-SWID-DOCUMENTS>> for more details about SWIDs.

The Spatial Web will use SWIDs as identifiers.

The `did:swid` method leverages a registry known as Spatial Web SWID Registry, which
is managed by a Designated Authority.
