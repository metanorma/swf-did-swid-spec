## Identifier

### Target System

The target system of the `did:swid` DID method is a registry known as Spatial
Web SWID Registry, which is managed by a Designated Authority.

### Method Name

The namestring that identifies this DID method is: `swid`. A DID that uses this
method MUST begin with the following prefix: `did:swid`. Per the DID
specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after
the prefix, is the [method-specific identifier](#method-specific-identifier),
specified below.

### Method-Specific Identifier

The `did:swid` method-specific identifier contains a [[ref:
self-certifying identifier]] (SCID) for the DID.
  
As specified in the following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
[[spec:rfc2234]] the [[ref: SCID]] **MUST** be present in the DID string. See
examples below.

```abnf
swid-did = "did:swid:" "z" scid
scid = 46(base58-btc-alphabet) 
```

The `scid` part of the `did:swid` identifier is generated by creating a cryptographic digest (hash)
of the first entry of the Cryptographic Event Log (see [The SWID Registry](#the-swid-registry)). The hash is encoded using
[[ref: multihash]].

The characters in the `base58-btc-alphabet` are as defined in the W3C [Controller Documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/cid-1.0/#multibase-0) specification.

Example SWID:
